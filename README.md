Description
Spaceman is a guessing game. There is a mystery word which the user tries to guess one letter at a time. A placeholder is initially shown, with the number of blanks corresponding to the number of letters in the word. If the letter is in the mystery word, the position(s) of the letter(s) are revealed in the placeholders. Guess the word before you run out of guesses!

Users win if they can guess the mystery word before the spaceman is drawn. The spaceman is made up of seven parts, and each part is drawn for each incorrect guess. If all seven parts get drawn before the user guesses the word, then they lose.
